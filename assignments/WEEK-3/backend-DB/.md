1. Generate package.json
  npm init -y

2. change type to module => you get error during import and export

3. create server.js

4. Install, Import "express" and create Http server. Assign port
  npm install express

### connect MongoDB database

            REST API      -> mongoDB native driver ->           MongoDB server
            REST API      -> mongoDB ODM tool ->           MongoDB server

5.  We can use Sequelize to write high level queries (ORM(Object Relational Mapper) tool) and that helps you to reduce using of raw queries

6. mongoose => ODM(Object Document Module) -> validation tools, ...etc

    a. Install mongoose (No need to install mongoDB as mongoose internally has mongoDB) and connect to mongoDB
    b. Insert only if it is valid therefore we need to 
      -> create a schema of resource => blue print of the doc 
      -> create model of that schema
      -> Perform DB operations on that model


Error handling => html error message to json format

Running validators during Update => it does not validate when you modify i.e, like age>18 

.gitignore
